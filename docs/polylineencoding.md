# Encoded Polyline

## Encoded Polyline Algorithm Format
Polyline encoding is a lossy compression algorithm that allows you to store a series of coordinates as a single string. Point coordinates are encoded using signed values.

The encoding process converts a binary value into a series of character codes for ASCII characters using the familiar base64 encoding scheme: to ensure proper display of these characters, encoded values are summed with 63 (the ASCII character '?') before converting them into ASCII. The algorithm also checks for additional character codes for a given point by checking the least significant bit of each byte group; if this bit is set to 1, the point is not yet fully formed and additional data must follow.

Additionally, to conserve space, **points only include the offset from the previous point** (except of course for the first point). All points are encoded in Base64 as signed integers, as latitudes and longitudes are signed values. The encoding format within a polyline needs to represent two coordinates representing latitude and longitude to a reasonable precision. Given a maximum longitude of +/- 180 degrees to a precision of 5 decimal places (180.00000 to -180.00000), this results in the need for a 32 bit signed binary integer value.

Note that the backslash is interpreted as an escape character within string literals. Any output of this utility should convert backslash characters to double-backslashes within string literals.

The steps for encoding such a signed value are specified below.

  1. Take the initial signed value:

    -179.9832104

  2. Take the decimal value and multiply it by 1e5, rounding the result:

    -17998321

  3. Convert the decimal value to binary. Note that a negative value must be calculated using its two's complement by inverting the binary value and adding one to the result:

    00000001 00010010 10100001 11110001
    11111110 11101101 01011110 00001110
    11111110 11101101 01011110 00001111

  4. Left-shift the binary value one bit:

    11111101 11011010 10111100 00011110

  5. If the original decimal value is negative, invert this encoding:

    00000010 00100101 01000011 11100001

  6. Break the binary value out into 5-bit chunks (starting from the right hand side):

    00001 00010 01010 10000 11111 00001

  7. Place the 5-bit chunks into reverse order:

    00001 11111 10000 01010 00010 00001

  8. OR each value with 0x20 if another bit chunk follows:

    100001 111111 110000 101010 100010 000001

  9. Convert each value to decimal:

    33 63 48 42 34 1

  10. Add 63 to each value:

    96 126 111 105 97 64

  11. Convert each value to its ASCII equivalent:

    `~oia@

The table below shows some examples of encoded points, showing the encodings as a series of offsets from previous points.
